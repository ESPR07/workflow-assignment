## Description
For this assignment we were tasked with creating automated systems for validating, formatting and testing our projects to ensure we don't encounter wrongfull commits and undoable errors. The website used for this project was provided by Noroff and was made by a teacher.

Assignment's key points:
- Configuring Prettier and eslint with a commit hook to check code when it's commited.
- Create Unit Tests for the login and logout event to make sure it works in every version of the project.
- Create E2E tests to see if the login/logout event works from a users perspective.
- Make a protection rule for the main branch using the built tests.
- Add a badge for the tests.

## Built With
